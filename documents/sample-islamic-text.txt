3. The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful,
4. Sovereign of the Day of Recompense.
5. It is You we worship and You we ask for help.
6. Guide us to the straight path
7. The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray.

Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow) - Selected Verses
255. Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.

Surah Al-Imran (Family of Imran) - Selected Verses
8. [Who say], "Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower.
9. Our Lord, surely You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt. Indeed, Allah does not fail in His promise."

Hadith Qudsi
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said: "Allah the Almighty said: I am as My servant thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assembly better than it. And if he draws near to Me an arm's length, I draw near to him a fathom's length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed."

The Five Pillars of Islam
1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith): "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."
2. Salah (Prayer): Performing the five daily prayers at their appointed times.
3. Zakat (Charity): Giving a portion of one's wealth to those in need.
4. Sawm (Fasting): Fasting during the month of Ramadan from dawn to sunset.
5. Hajj (Pilgrimage): Making the pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if able.

Islamic Ethics and Morality
The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said: "The most perfect believer in faith is the one who is best in character." This hadith emphasizes the importance of good character in Islam. Muslims are encouraged to be honest, kind, just, and compassionate in all their dealings.

The concept of Taqwa (God-consciousness) is central to Islamic ethics. It involves being aware of Allah's presence at all times and acting in accordance with His guidance. This includes being truthful, keeping promises, showing respect to parents and elders, and being kind to neighbors and the poor.

Islamic Family Values
Islam places great emphasis on family values and relationships. The family is considered the foundation of society. Parents are to be treated with respect and kindness, as mentioned in the Quran: "And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honor."

Marriage in Islam is considered a sacred contract between two people, and both partners have rights and responsibilities. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The best among you are those who are best to their families."

Islamic Economics
Islam promotes economic justice and fairness. The prohibition of interest (riba) is a fundamental principle of Islamic economics. Instead, Islam encourages trade and investment that benefits society as a whole.

Zakat, the obligatory charity, serves as a means of wealth redistribution and social welfare. It is calculated as 2.5% of one's wealth above a certain threshold and is distributed to specific categories of people in need.

Environmental Stewardship
Islam teaches that humans are stewards (khalifa) of the Earth and are responsible for its care and preservation. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The world is beautiful and verdant, and verily God, be He exalted, has made you His stewards in it, and He sees how you acquit yourselves."

This includes conserving water, planting trees, and treating animals with kindness. The Quran mentions: "And do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."

Islamic Education
Seeking knowledge is highly valued in Islam. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "Seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim." This includes both religious and secular knowledge that benefits humanity.

Islamic education emphasizes the development of both the mind and the soul, encouraging critical thinking while maintaining moral and ethical values.

The Concept of Jihad
Jihad, often misunderstood, primarily refers to the internal struggle against one's own negative inclinations and desires. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The best jihad is the jihad of the one who strives against his own self for Allah."

This includes striving to be a better person, controlling one's anger, and working for the betterment of society through peaceful means.

Islamic Social Justice
Islam promotes social justice and equality. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "All people are equal, as equal as the teeth of a comb. There is no claim of merit of an Arab over a non-Arab, or of a white over a black person, or of a male over a female. Only God-fearing people merit a preference with God."

This principle extends to all aspects of social life, including employment, education, and access to resources.

The Importance of Community
Islam emphasizes the importance of community (ummah) and collective responsibility. Muslims are encouraged to support each other and work together for the common good. The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "The believers in their mutual kindness, compassion and sympathy are just like one body. When one of the limbs suffers, the whole body responds to it with wakefulness and fever."

This sense of community extends beyond religious boundaries, as Muslims are taught to be good neighbors and citizens regardless of the religious beliefs of others.
